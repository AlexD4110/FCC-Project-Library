Install packages using npm

npm i nodemon
npm i mongodb
npm i mongoose


Create models.js file
Create db-connection.js file
Connect to db-connection.js file in server.js with express

Add in mongo db connection string in env file

At this point you can work on adding in routes to api.js and fullfil user stories

First I started with adding in the required packaged in the models.js as well as the db-connection.js file

From here it is just working on creating funcitonality of the api routes.
